        <p id="description"> HK-style egg waffles are a popular street snack characterized by their unusual, bubble-like texture. Made out of waffle ingredients, the waffles are cooked in a special mold that gives them their rounded, bubble shape. The exterior of the snack is usually crispy, while the inside is soft and fluffy. The waffles come served in a variety of flavors as well as toppings, often customizable to your liking.</p>

        <li>Preheat your egg waffle pan over medium heat and lightly grease it with vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li> In another bowl, whisk the eggs. Then add the milk, water, vanilla extract, and vegetable oil. Mix until smooth. </li>
        <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking until you have a smooth batter. Let it rest for about 10-15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Pour enough batter into the preheated waffle pan to fill it about halfway. Close the pan and cook for about 2-3 minutes, flipping it halfway through, until the waffles are golden brown and crispy. </li>
        <li>Carefully remove the egg waffles from the pan and serve immediately. You can enjoy them plain or top with fresh fruit, ice cream, chocolate sauce, or condensed milk.</li>
